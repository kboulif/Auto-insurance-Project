# Auto-insurance-Project


In this project, we will explore and analyze and model a data that countains about 8000 rows. 
The target variable is 'TARGET_FLAG' which is a categorical variable that has two possible values '0' or '1'. '1' Means that 
the person was in a car crash, and '0' means that the person was not in a car crash. 
This is a classification problem that aims to predict if a person will crash its car or not.
